# DocxStudentNameChanger
Changes the contents of the cells of the docx files automatically combined with a shell script for further control over my work

One has to place the files to be updated on the Desktop and rest would be handled automatically

Some Dependencies have to be installed before running the python script .
For simplicity One could use Anaconda which comes with most of the modules pre-installed

For Dependencies one could refer to the script and install the modules written against the import statements in the python script.

One could easily alter the script according to their usage.
Enjoy...!
